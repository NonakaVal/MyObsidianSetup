# post 1 - 5 most important design rules

## 1. Clear message - without concept only emptiness
- the lack of a clear message is an empty shell
## 2. Make it simple
- too many images and effects disrupts communication
## 3. Be clear
- your message must be clear and understood by all
## 4. No visual cacophony
- all the elements communicate the with the others
## 5. Less is more
+ more, is often too much, quite simple
It’s as simple as that. If you start following them, you will become a great designer.


# post 2 - how to evaluate ux/ui design ?
## ask yourself several questions
###  1 - UX 
- Does the site (or app) follow accessibility best practices ?
- Do the colors used meet WCAG standards ?
- Do the texts have readable sizes ?
- Can text sizes be changed without third-party technology support ?
- Are the images consistent with the associated descriptions ? 
- Do buttons forms fields and others interactive contents meet WCAG standards
- Does the site (or app) adapt to the size or of the screen on which it is displayed ?
- Is it easy to understand the purpose of the site ?
- Is it easy, as a user, to do what we come to do on the site ?
### 2 - UI - 
- Does the site look professional or does something on the site look suspicious ?
- Are the buttons and links easily recognizable and accessible ?
- Is it easy to read and understand the content presented on the screen ?
## 3 - basic rules to create a clean and efficient interface 
### typography
#### Font consistent
- Knowing how to limit yourself makes it possible to create more harmonious interfaces. Use different styles and different contrasts to prioritize information.
- use a maximum of 2 differents fonts on the same screen
- use a maximum of 3 different text sizes on the same component
### structure
- use a grid when creating the interface to have a more coherent design, but also to facilitate rendering at different sizes  
-   always have consistent spaces between elements do not neglect the empty around the content
- 
### Did you know that 88% of users who have had a bad user experience on a site will not return? 68% of internet users even say they leave a site directly if they find the UX worse, without even being interested in the content. 
- So, it is important to test and measure UX to ensure that your customers experience your product as you imagine it. 
- To evaluate the ergonomics, UI and UX of an application or website, we can refer to common standard, but also ask ourselves different questions.
- tools to measure UX design 
- software such as hotjar oir heatmap gather data and allow you to visualize clicks, page views, time spend on each page, etc  [Hotjar](https://www.hotjar.com/)

# post 3 - UX personas
ux personas are useless, unless created properly
documentation is only useful if it's used
however the majority of UX personas I've seen are of one help whatsoever - what is that ?
Mostly because people tend to write down stuff that is irrelevant to product management or UX design 
## What makes a good persona then, 

### ux persona cargo cult     
#### Empathetic design:
- You can document user research findings and enable the people involved in product development to practice empathy through product decisions.
#### Decision making:  
- Guiding your product
- decisions depending on your users' traits.
#### Documenting research findings:
- A user persona document should be the hub that's frequently consulted
- and updated. That's one of the places you go to when in doubt

### ASSUMPTIONS-BASED APPROACHES
#### Generally, you would do the bulk of research in the earlier stages of the product design process. Your research activities may include:
- Qualitative methods
- User interviews
- Usability testing.
- Card sorting
- Quantitative research 
- Surveys
- A/b testings
- Usage data such as conversions, user retention, adoption rates, etc.

  ### GETTING IT PERFECT ON THE FIRST ATTEMPT
#### UX personas should be updated regularly. 
The first draft will be messy.
That's the point of iterative approaches. You build new findings on top of the old ones
People ignore products that ignore people  

### CREATING A USEFUL PERSONA
- Conduct a workshop with stakeholders to talk about different user types.
- It's important to invite a wide range of experts
- Share all the data and prior research.
- Write down information on different user types.
- If there are only a few patterns emerging, or your personas feel generic, you're likely not going deep enough.
- Try to dissect the main differences in terms of behavior, needs, pain points, and the information users are looking for.
- Create baselines for your personas.
- Validate and enhance those baselines with doing research and interviews.
- Document the results.

  ### IDEAS IN BRIEF
- UX personas are meaningful for product management and UX design only if they are based on real data and not on assumptions.
- Leveraging UX personas is key to
- empathizing with users, making informed decisions, and designing valuable products.
- A common mistake is overlooking the research stage or not putting enough effort and time into refining UX personas.
- It is vital to get as deep as possible and collect relevant information by communicating with stakeholders, conducting prior research and interviews.


# post 5- how to choose the right colors 
## THE IMPORTANCE OF COLORS
- A study conducted on the mental impact of color found that color increased brand recognition by an average of 80%.

### PRIMARY COLOR
- To find the right primary color, you need to understand what you are selling.
- The best way to do this is to think about the mood of your product and browse the colors that match that mood.

### ADDITIONAL COLORS
- Use a color wheel to help you find colors that work together.
- The complementary colors are located directly opposite each other and the three primary colors are on the points of the triangle.

### BACKGROUND COLOR
- This is an important color choice, as the background of your website will theoretically take up more space than any other color.
- If you don't want to take any chances, make the entire website off-white, which is the most common choice.
  
### FONT COLOR
- You can go for a classic: black. However, a black font on a white background can cause eye strain, as there is 100% contrast.
- The gray or gray-tinted color can give your website a softer and more inviting look.


# post 6- successful product page
## Product page objectives
### The ultimate goal of a product page is to generate sales. To achieve this goal, the page must do several things.
- Explain what's for sale
- Building trust
- Create an experience
- Be intuitive
## Content of a product page
### The content of a product page is structured around above the fold, before the bottom of the screen cut off the rest of the page.
- Header
- Product description → Product images
- Call to action

## The content of the product pages depends on the products

### Some elements should not be placed at the top of the page
- Additionalinformation
- Accompanying Charts
- Recommended products
- Testimonials
## Best practices for creating a product page
-  Use the right design software
- Sketch and Figma allow the creation of sophisticated models. InvisionApp creates interactive prototypes to accelerate the testing process.
- choose a layout based on a template
- consider the rest of the site
- Prioritize information
- Product pages must strike a delicate balance between informing visitors and overwhelming them with information.
- Tell a story with pictures
- Images are the most eye-catching elements of a product page, as they are faster to decipher.
- Don't underestimate user-generated content

## Allow users to submit their own public reviews, questions and product photos.

### Test, analyze, repeat

#### The success of your product page depends on consumers buying what you have to offer. Use analytics tools like Glew or Google Analytics

#### Lesson of the day
- People love to buy products but hate being sold products
- The product pages of a website are dedicated to selling a company’s products or services.
- A product page is designed to inform and persuade, which means it must get the customer to click the « Add to Cart » button.
- reating a product page is a challenge, because a beautiful design is not always a design that generates a lot of conversion.
#### Here is a recap of good practices to adopt :
- Use the right design software
- Choose a layout based on a template
- Consider the rest of the site
- Prioritize the information
- Tell a story with images
- Don’t underestimate user-generated content
- Test, analyze, repeat

# post 7- a ux story
Finding inspiration for your UX and UI design
It happens to all of us, you get stuck.  
When we approach a UX/UI design, it’s tempting to go right to an existing product or process and pick it apart.
This has value, and our own heuristic evaluations can inform our design.
But it can also limit our vision and viewpoint to just what is already there.
Interviewing users is another great option. It can help us see other viewpoints. To really get inspired though, sometimes you have to get out of the office and try it yourself.

Parenting links the properties of one UI element to the properties of others.

## 4. Transformation

Transformation occurs when one UI element turns into another.

## 5. Value Change

Value change communicates the dynamic nature of data representations

## 5. Value Change

Value change communicates the dynamic nature of data representations

## 6. Dolly and Zoom

Dolly and zoom allow users to "travel" through UI elements spatially

## 7. Dimensionality

Dimensionality makes it seem as though UI elements have multiple interactive sides.

## 8. Parallax

Parallax is displayed when two (or more) UI elements move at the same time but at different speeds

## 9. Obscuration

It requires interaction to open, but it's possible to discern what awaits on the other side.

## 10. Clonning

Cloning is a motion behavior wherein one UI element splits off into others.

## 11. Overlay

Overlay creates the illusion of foreground/background distinction in the 2D space of Uls.

# post -11 - 6 basic principles of consistency
Consistency is one of the most powerful usability principles: when things always behave the same, users don't have to worry about what will happen.
## How Does It Help?
### The consistency of elements reduces the number of actions that a user has to make to achieve his goal..

 - 1 Use easy language, familiar terms, and phrasepatterns.
 - 2. Offset and Delay - Offset and delay creates hierarchy between UI elements
 - 3 Use the standard website layouts when planning UI.
 - 4- Don't deceive your user's expectations. Your website's interface should "carry out" its functions 
 - 5- Follow the consistency of visual elements.
Fonts, colors, content, etc. should fit together.
- 6 - We should follow the consistency principle when it is necessary.
### Build your website using consistency and standard principles. Why so? To create a strong website, first, and meet your users’ needs. Also, to make their interactions with your product easy and effective. What else on earth do we need?!
- Following the standards, you reduce misunderstanding when users interact with your product.
- People tend to act the way they’ve already acted using other websites. So when we deny the consistency and standards principle, it may cause confusion for users as they have already gotten used to acting a certain way.

# post-12-things - things UX-/ui designers forget to design 
- Your Ul makes customers happy because the way you solve their business problems is so good. That's why you sometimes forget about the other
sub-components of the UI.
- 1. Onboarding screen
When you first open a downloaded app, the main introductory screens are onboarding screen.
- 2. Skeleton loader
Skeleton is simply a predefined set of frames that replaces the content you want to display while waiting for the data to be loaded.
- 3. Empty state
Empty states are the states when the user enters a page but has nothing to display.
- 4. The splash screen
The splash screen is the intro screen that users see when they launch the app or website
As a UX UI Designer, you are involved in the product development process from the first steps of just a customer requirement file to a complete UI. 
##### The nature of the work makes the focus on handling the core issues of the project.   Your UI makes customers happy because the way you solve their business problem is so good. That’s why you sometimes forget about the other sub-components of the UI.
- Without it, your product will still work fine, but from a user perspective, the lack of these components will make their experience significantly worse.
+ In becoming a senior UX UI designer, you should improve these points and give the client and the development team the most complete UI version possible.
- Here are the components that many UX UI designers forget in the design process.

- Onboarding screen

- Skeleton loader

- Empty state

- The splash screen

- 404 error page

- No internet state

Gestalt Principles: How To Apply Them In Your UX/UI Design Projects.

  

Gestalt Principles define some basic laws that help us understand how the human mind perceives visual stimuli.

  

Gestalt principles are about how humans organize their perceptions. They inform us on how people form perceptions and give meaning to those perceptions based on their existing knowledge and prior experiences.

  

Principle of continuity

The law of continuity states that elements positioned in a line (or curve) are perceived as a continuation, or a follow-up of the previous element.

Principle of similarity

The Gestalt principle of similarity explores the fact that similar elements are perceived as being part of the same group and having the same function.

Principle of proximity

This law affirms that we perceive elements that are closer to each other to belong in the same group.

Principle of figure-ground

This Gestalt law states that our perception instinctively perceives objects as either being in the foreground or the background.

Principle of closure

This Gestalt principle states that we use memory to convert complex objects into simpler or known shapes

Principle of common region

This principle states that when objects are positioned within the same closed region, they are perceived as part of the same group.

Principle of focal points

The focal point law states that any element that stands out visually captures and holds the viewer's attention.

  
  

Here are other factors that you should take into consideration when developing animations for your interface:

  

1. Screen size

2. Easing

3. Linear movement

4. Ease-in

5. Ease-out

6. Ease-in-out
