## Internet Basic concepts and terminology

- Packet - A small unit of data that is transmitted over the internet
- Router - A device that directs packs of data between different networks
- IP address - A unique identifier assigned to each device on a network, used to route data to the correct destination
- Domain Name - A human-readable name that is used to identify a website.
- DNS - The domain name system is responsible for translate domain names to into IP address 
- HTTP - The hypertext transfer protocol is used to transfer data between a client (such as a web browser) and a server (such as a website)
- HTTPS - An encrypted version o f HTTP that is used to provide secure communication
- SSL/TLS - The secure sockets layer and transport layer security protocols are used to provide secure communication over the internet 

## Building Applications with TCP-IP concepts

- Ports - used to identify the application or service running on a device 
- Sockets - A socket is a combination of an IP address and port number, representing a specific endpoint for communication.
## Securing internet communication with SSL/TLS

SSL/TLS is a protocol used to encrypt data being transmitted over the internet. 


### Key concepts to understand

- Certificates - SSL-TLS certificates are used to establish trust between the client and server
- Handshake - During the SSL/TLS handshake process, the client and server exchange information to negotiate the encryption algorithm ando other parameters for secure connection.
- Encryption - Once the secure connection is established, data os encrypted using the agreed-upon algorithm and can be transmitted securely between the client and server.
