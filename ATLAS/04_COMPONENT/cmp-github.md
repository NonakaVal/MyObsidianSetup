# Git Command Cheat Sheet

## üõ†Ô∏è Basic Setup
```bash
# Check Git version
git --version

# Initialize new repository
git init
```

## üì¶ Staging & Committing
```bash
# Stage files (specific file or all changes)
git add <filename>  # or git add .

# Check current status
git status

# Commit staged changes
git commit -m "Descriptive message"
```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Remote Repositories
```bash
# Connect local repo to GitHub
git remote add origin <repository-url>

# Push to remote (first time)
git push -u origin main

# Subsequent pushes
git push
```

## üåø Branch Management
```bash
# Create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b feature/new-button

# Switch back to previous branch
git checkout -

# Push branch to remote
git push origin feature/new-button

# Merge branches (while on target branch)
git merge feature/new-button
```

## üîÑ Syncing Changes
```bash
# Pull latest changes
git pull

# Alternative: fetch + merge
git fetch
git merge origin/main
```

## üìù Best Practices
1. **Commit Messages**:
   - Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
   - Keep first line under 50 chars
   - Add details after blank line if needed

2. **Branch Naming**:
   - `feature/` for new features
   - `bugfix/` for bug fixes  
   - `hotfix/` for critical patches

3. **Workflow**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature
   # Make changes...
   git add .
   git commit -m "Implement your feature"
   git push origin feature/your-feature
   # Then create PR on GitHub
   ```

> **Pro Tip**: Use `git log --oneline --graph` to visualize your branch history!
