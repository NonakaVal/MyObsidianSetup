# Product-Market Fit Framework

## 🚨 Fundamental Rule
**Never sell a bad product** - Achieving PMF comes first

## 🔍 PMF Validation Checklist
1. **Existing Sales** - Is the company already selling?
2. **Market Acceptance** - Does the business model resonate?
3. **Channel Fit** - Are distribution channels effective?
4. **Price Testing** - Is the pricing strategy optimal?

## 🧩 PMF Variables Matrix
| Lever | Adjustment Impact |
|-------|-------------------|
| Market Segment | Target audience refinement |
| Product Features | Value proposition tuning | 
| Pricing Model | Monetization optimization |
| Distribution Channel | Customer acquisition paths |

## 🎯 Innovation Grid
**Commercialization Models**:
- **Product-Led Growth (PLG)**  
  - Example: Spotify  
  - Characteristics:  
    • Product sells itself  
    • Minimal sales team  
    • Low customer acquisition cost (CAC)  

- **Market-Led Growth (MLG)**  
  - Characteristics:  
    • Channel partnerships  
    • Intermediate complexity  
    • Hybrid sales approach  

- **Sales-Led Growth (SLG)**  
  - Example: Enterprise SaaS  
  - Characteristics:  
    • High-ticket items  
    • Dedicated sales teams  
    • Complex onboarding  
    • High CAC  

## 📌 Key Principle
**Every project has unique context** - Choose growth model based on:
- Product complexity  
- Customer segment  
- Price point  
- Required support level  

> **Strategic Insight**: Start with PLG validation before investing in sales infrastructure. Complex products often require SLG approaches.
