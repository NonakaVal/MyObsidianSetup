Stopping the scroll is 80% of the content battle.  
  
Mind-blowing knowledge bombs, jaw-dropping belief shifts or viral-worthy skits won’t mean anything if they’re buried behind a lazy 💩 hook.  
  
Here are some examples of the hook I mentioned ⬇️  
  
👉 TRANSITIONS  
Whether it’s a zoom, whip, or glitch, add a transition at the beginning of your video to get people stopping dead in their tracks.  
  
👉 TEXT ANIMATION  
Large animated text is another great way to create jarring dynamic movement in the first couple of seconds.  
  
👉 GET WEIRD  
Let your imagination roam free. Just try not to do anything that’ll get you flagged by Instagram.  
  
👉 MOVEMENT  
Jump into frame, camera movement, hand gestures, do a backflip (at your own discretion).  
  
👉 BE COUNTER-INTUITIVE  
Say something bold that goes against logic or the status quo. Make sure your lesson is relevant or it’s just clickbait.
