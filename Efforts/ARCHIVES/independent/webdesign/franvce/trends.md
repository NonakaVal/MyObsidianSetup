# post- 9 - trends 22-23 Design Inspiration
## Graphics and design are continuously changing and evolving. Last season's trends feel like a decade ago and we're always on our toes for what's to come.

### Colorful Minimalism

- Distinctive features: graphics, although seemingly complex, rely on simple shapes-circles, rectangles, and triangles are easy to recognize
- 3D Forms
Distinctive features: you guessed it... three-dimensionality, volume, and the imitation of real materials (i.e. metal).
- Flat with Textures
Distinctive features: simplicity of form, emphasized two-dimensionality of objects, and mandatory texture (most often executed in its classic "noisy" texture).
- Hand Drawn' Art
Distinctive features: the name speaks for itself - let's entertain the idea that not everything is created to look like it had the help of a computer.
- Mixing styles and collages
Distinctive features: One can complement a 3D scene with flat doodles, or add elements of photography to a classic illustration.
- Retro wave
Distinctive features: nostalgic color scheme and graphic elements-neon or worn out colors, metal like gradients, and minimalistic geometric shapes.

### Conclusion

Whether or not to follow current trends is entirely up to you; suitable designs and graphics are achievable in a variety of styles.
It never hurts, though, to "refresh" the design of your project(s) from time to time, in order to communicate to customers that you are not static, but in fact versatile and adaptable to an ever changing world of design and style.
Here are the graphic trends of 2022-2023 for graphic designers, UX UI and Web designers.
