- Me and this moment before it runs out
- Let me hold your hand and dance 'round and 'round the flame
- Just watch my wildest dreams come true,  Not one of them involving you.
- The deeper I get, the less that I know, The less that I know, the deeper I go
- And all of the walls that they built in the seventies finally fall
- I'm testing the limits of what a mind can do
- Clinging to promises, fighting off the vignette, Tunnels cave, visions fade, swallowed by the vignette
- Pardon my delay, I'm navigating my head
- So please, keep it in mind
- running around in circles feeling caged by endless rules
-
