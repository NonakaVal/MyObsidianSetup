It's full moon again  
Crazy how time flies  
One might wonder  
If the path is in the right direction

But I do believe  
Things come to life by accident  
When it remains on  
Sounds like it's meant to be

New space made when things fall apart  
(Get up!) What matters after ending's how you left a mark  
(Don't wait up!) Fire in my soul, fire in my heart  
'Til you see me on the other side of stars, I'm running

All the journeys start somewhere with a first step  
No one's sure what lies ahead, be bold and brave (ooh, stand up!)  
Roads may be rough and tough  
Though it will lead somewhere (oh)  
(Nothing easy, get up and go! Get it, go!)

Sometimes it's the journey itself that teaches  
A lot about the destination not aware of (ooh)  
No matter how far (no matter how far)  
How you go (how you go, how you go)  
How long it may last (carpe diem, no time to waste, you gotta)  
Venture life, burn your dread (venture life, go get it, burn your dread)

When there's a beginning  
There's an ending too  
As we go  
We come across many predicaments

Delight lies beneath  
Colors of life that's excellent  
Though pictures fade away  
Beauty will remain the same

Stop living dead when your heart's beating still  
(Hope!) No slowing down for me, I'm never gonna chill  
(Go!) Every low phase, I ride it like a drill  
I'll abide by the rules, but outshine and prove

Only time will tell the magnitude of deeds  
Longer we wait, may it be the sweeter kiss (ooh)  
(Or will it? Only time will tell)  
Standing by for answers  
Shall it ease the pain? (Oh)  
(Nothing easy, get up and go! Get it, go!)

Only from the heart, one reaches to the sky  
Ups and downs they go, so hands up and enjoy the ride (ooh)  
As you go (as you go)  
Believe in (believe in)  
The faith and yourself (carpe diem, no time to waste)  
Venture with no regret (you gotta venture life, go get it, no regret)

Choices one makes reflect hope and fear  
Be brave, endure the pain  
Then one might just gain the strength one sought  
Which may be hearts and souls of life  
Meanings all of us search for

Question, no answers  
Will this be for nothing?  
I felt so, so worthless and nervous, disgusted  
I would be so broken unless I conducted  
Diligently, patiently, and trusted myself  
Nothing was given to me, so gonna go earn it  
Every pain is another motivation, I burn it  
Trepidation doesn't stop death, but it stops life  
Accepting open minds for lights

One day, these quiet voices will be heard  
Loud and clear, the story of the ones we miss (ooh)  
(Stand up!) But shed no tears  
Realize what they left behind (oh)  
(Nothing easy, get up and go! Get it, go!)

Explore within the limits of the time  
No one should need a permit to a way of life (ooh)  
No matter how far (no matter how far)  
How you go (how you go, how you go)  
How short it may last (carpe diem, no time to waste, you gotta)  
Venture life, burn your dread (venture life, go get it, burn your dread)
